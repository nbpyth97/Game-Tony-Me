Greetings, you have chosen your class and are ready to explore the world. You see three different paths before you, which one do you choose?

>you ignore the shed and continue your journey
>you enter the shed and find a Dagger. you gain +10 ATK

2.
You have chosen the second path and arrived at a swamp. You can either cross the swamp or go around it, what's your decision?
>you cross the swamp by swimming and your garments are wet and smell nasty. you loose -10 DEF
>you go around the swamp which leads you to a place with a big tree. do you wish to rest there and spend your night?
  >you rest the night at the tree and sleep well under a heaven full of stars. you gain +5 HP
  >you continue your journey through the night to reach the other end of the swamp. 

3.
You have chosen the third path. You encounter another traveller. Do you wish to speak to him or continue your journey?
>you speak to the traveller. The traveller tells you about about danger ahead and to not fall for the tricks. he hands you a piece of paper and tells you to only read it when the time is right. you remain curious and continue forward.
>you ignore the traveller and continue your journey.

You have arrived at a big stone plate with engraved writings. You are curious and begin to read it. "Only those worthy will have an easy day, while those ignorant will suffer a horrible night."
