You pass through old ruins and you feel uneasy. Something or someone is watching you. You prepare to fight as a werewolf ambushes you. Do you wish to engage in the fight or try fleeing?
  >you dodge the enemies attacks and make a run for it but he hits you with his claws in in your back. You start bleeding but continue to run away. You end up hiding behind a big rock. Do you wish to stay hidden or continue running?
    >you wash away your blood on the back with some water and continue running. You arrive at the entrance to Orclandia and are safe from the werewolf.

3.
You have chosen the third path. You encounter another traveller. Do you wish to speak to him or continue your journey?
>you speak to the traveller. The traveller tells you about about danger ahead and to not fall for the tricks. he hands you a piece of paper and tells you to only read it when the time is right. you remain curious and continue forward.
>you ignore the traveller and continue your journey.

You have arrived at a crossroad. One path is easy to walk on with grass and flowers on the sides, while the other is muddy and dark. There is a big stone plate with engraved writings. You are curious and begin to read it. "Only those worthy will have an easy day, while those ignorant will suffer a horrible night."
  (IF THE PLAYER HAS THE LETTER)
  >you remember the letter that the traveller gave to you and open it. It reads "Society tames the wolf into a dog. And man is the most domesticated animal of all."
    >Which path do you want to take? the grass or the mud path?
      >you choose the grass path. you walk for hours and the path seems endless. There is no place to rest just open fields everywhere you look. Night approaches and it starts freezing. You don't wake up from this nightmare.
      (GAME OVER)
      >you choose the mud path. At first you feel stupid for not having chosen the grass path but after a while you start seeing the entrace to Tugaland and feel happy that you made that choice. 
      (ARRIVE AT TUGALAND)
  
  (IF THE PLAYER DOESN'T HAVE THE LETTER)
    >Which path do you want to take? the grass or the mud path?
      >you choose the grass path. you walk for hours and the path seems endless. There is no place to rest just open fields everywhere you look. Night approaches and it starts freezing.
